1. Client -> request
2. Request goes to web.xml
3. web.xml should be configured to say that all the requests should be sent to the DispatcherServlet. (Front controller that we don't write, it is inbuilt in the spring package - it controls all the controllers and makes them easier to manage.)
4. The front controller knows about all the controllers in the application. Controllers are the ones that perform the business logic.
5. The Dispatcher Servlet needs a config file to tell for which request to call which controller.
6. All your controllers will be annotated with @Controller. Every Controller will have some mapping. You have to only mention in your config file - in which package you have all the controllers.
7. The controller returns the model (data) and the page name. 
8. The Dispatcher Servlet calls the view and then returns to the client.
